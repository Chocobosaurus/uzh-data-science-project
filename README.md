# UZH Data Science Project: Navigating Zurich
Project work in the course "Introduction to Data Science" at University of Zurich.
We investigate the public transportation system in the city of Zurich using data analytic techniques.

## Data

The data can be downloaded from the data collection of Zurich at [data.stadt-zuerich.ch](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrgastzahlen_ogd.).
We provide snapshots of the data in the `data/` folder that allow reproducing the results of this project.
